The fully working webpage is now available at [whoisinmyphoto.com](https://www.whoisinmyphoto.com)

## Steps:
1. Open the webpage [whoisinmyphoto.com](https://www.whoisinmyphoto.com)
2. Click “Start with making folders of your friends and family!”
3. Click “Choose Files” and upload a folder with multiple images of people (for demo, make sure to upload a folder that we provided for the assignment: ObamaFamilyImage)
4. Click “Upload” to upload the images (wait until the loading ends)
5. Type the number of people in the box (4 for demo as there are four people in Obama’s family)
6. Click “Submit” to submit the number of people data
7. Go to next page by clicking green “Next” button
8. Write name of each person in the image (For demo, the names should be “Barack”, “Michelle”, “Malia”, “Sasha”)
9. Click the “Submit” button after each of the name box fills (Be careful not to click the submit button more than 4 times total. The system deliberately gives error if the number of people data and number of submit is different)
10. Go to next page by clicking green “Next” button (The loading may take up to 5 minutes, so please be patient)
11. Click “Download” text to download the organized folder with subfolders of names of the people
12. All done! Check the zip file whether every image seems to be organized correctly!



## What to do when error comes up:
1. (For most problems) Click the “Reset” text at the end of each page to reset all the data uploaded or entered data and start again from the home page of http://dqj5182.pythonanywhere.com/
2. The webpage may give errors between annotation page and classify page because of the long time duration from our face recognition model. If so, please go back to the home page http://dqj5182.pythonanywhere.com/ and go to the next page and click the reset button. This will delete all the information entered by you and you can start over the service with no problem.
3. If there is an error during a demo due to deviation from steps above that is not solved with the “Reset” button, please let us know so that we can renew the service.
